# PYNC - The Python File Sync

**NOTE:** This program is *very* early in its development lifetime. At this current point in time, it will copy files from 1 directory to another, assuming it matches this criterea:

- the destination file does not exist
- if it does exist, they are not the same AND the source file is newer

Planned Features:
[] .pyncignore file
[] "run and forget" style, automatically checking for modifications in the source directory
